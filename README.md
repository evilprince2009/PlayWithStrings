## PlayWithStrings

Along with array and linked list data structures, a string is another popular topic of programming questions. A good thing about the string is that if you know the array, you can solve string-based questions easily because strings are nothing but a character array.

So all the techniques you learn by solving array-based coding questions can be used to solve string programming questions as well.

### Here is a list of few string coding questions with solutions.

- How do you get duplicate characters from a string ? (solution -> `GetDuplicateCharacters(string text): List <char>`)
- How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other ? (solution -> `AreAnagrams(string first, string second): bool`)
- How do you print the first non-repeated character from a string ? (solution -> `FirstNonRepeatedCharacter(string text): char`)
- How can a given string be reversed without concatenation ? (solution -> `Reverse(string text): string`)
- How do you check if a string contains only digits ? (solution -> `AreDigits(string text): bool`)
- How are duplicate characters found in a string ? (solution -> `FindDuplicateChars(string text): List<char>`)
- How do you count a number of vowels and consonants in a given string ? (solution -> `CountVowels(string text): int`)
- How do you count the occurrence of a given character in a string ? (solution -> `CharacterOccurance(string text, char character): int`)
- How do you find all permutations of a string ? (solution -> `ossiblePermutationCount(string text): int`)
- How do you reverse words in a given sentence ? (solution -> `ReverseWords(string text): string`)
- How do you check if two strings are a rotation of each other ? (solution -> `AreRotations(string first, string second): bool`)
- How do you check if a given string is a palindrome? (solution -> `IsPalindrome(string text): bool`)

These questions help improve your knowledge of string as a data structure. If you can solve all these String questions without any help then you are in good shape.
